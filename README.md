# In-game-toxicity-detection

*   Best_model.pt is the saved model we submitted on kaggle
*   Chat.csv is the data used to train the word embedding for aspect 3 domain features.
*   Please do not run anything in section 3.2.3 (BERT section)
* Please run sections 0, 1, 2, 3.1, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4, 5.0 sequentially first before running section 5.
* If you run any parts of section 5.3-5.7, make sure you run the first cell under the subsection heading that sets the embedding matrix variable.
* The model design of the best model is in 4.3.1 (in the title), we did not create a specific section for this to make the code running to be more smooth.
* Evaluation result per ablation study is shown at the end as a markdown table from train model results logs shown.
